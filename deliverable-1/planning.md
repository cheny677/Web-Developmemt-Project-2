## Q1:  What are you planning to build?

We plan to build **multi-platform applications** along with a website for teens who chose to take control of their own education to have a personal space to organize and present any creation of their interest. They can upload any medium of their work they are proud of but may not be recognized yet.

Our platform will be like GitHub, but instead of code work, we want them to post anything they want and can make it private or public. They can log in, create portfolios, share videos, photos, and word-based content on the website. So they can use this platform to organize their work to apply to post-secondary school or even for employment.

## Q2:  Who are your target users?
**The target users are high school graduates who are self-directed learners looking for a post-secondary school or job applicants.**

### Personas:

- Booboo, a drop out high school student who wants to apply for secondary school. Although he dropped out of high school, he still wants an app to keep track of lessons he learned to apply for college.

- Bob, a high school student, with many extracurricular achievements, wants to organize all his achievements. He has so many certificates, awards of merit and SAT scores that he wishes to organize so he can apply for the universities he wants to attend.

- Lisa, a photographer who has a lot of amazing pictures and would like to use these pictures to apply to college. Unlike normal high school students, Lisa focuses on taking pictures and she would like a place to put all her pictures together so she can use them to apply for art school.

- Amy, a dropout high school student, who only has an interest in coding. She would like to skip college and looking for a job as a software engineer. She would like to use this app to organize all the projects she has done to apply for a job and show the interviewers at her interview.

## Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Students who are self-directed learners currently do not have a very organized and official way of showcasing their achievements. Thus they can use our website to create their portfolio to show exactly and diversely what they are capable of and how well-rounded they are.

Our program will allow the users to record the whole creating progress of the works. It would efficiently organize the data to have them easily accessible and presented aesthetically. Mentors can also comment under the works to give guidance.

Currently, students use Google Documents to show their work, which is not effective and time-consuming.

## Q4: How will you build it?

For **mobile** applications, we decided to build to two major platforms: iOS and Android. Specifically, we want to use Xcode as the development tool and Swift as the development language for iOS application development, and use Android Studio as the tool and Java as the development language for Android application development.

For **web** development, we want to use Vue.js, HTML/CSS/Javascript to build the frontend of the website.

For the **server**, we will deploy a database in our server using MySQL, so different platforms can share and modify the same data. Also, we will deploy a server-side website using Django (Python) as the development framework. To let our website alive online, we will deploy Apache on the server to publish our website.

## Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

- As a **painter** who is willing to share their work, I wanted to upload every progress of my work with the comments of my own understanding of art on to the internet, so that my friends / fans can learn about where my inspiration comes from, so that my experience could help them.

- As a **dropout student** due to personal issues, I still want to learn, and I want to take the courses online, so that I can continue my education.

 - As a student who cannot go to school because of **physical issues**, I want a convenient application to upload and organize my profiles, certificates and other material. I wish to use this app to help me with my college applications.

- As a **senior high school artist**, I’m interested in photography, video editing and music production. I want to upload my work so that my friends and tutors are able to see my talents and give me some advice.

 - As a **sport specialist student**, I filmed a lot of my training videos and posted on Youtube, but I want to apply for sport related schools along with my certificates and records, so i want a package that can show the admission office my complete information.

## Q7: What operational events will you have as a team?

We will have two main meetings per week, the first meeting is meant to discuss what we should do next and the problems we encountered. The second meeting is held for checking progress. If necessary, we will hold extra meetings to deal with emergent situations.
 
The first meeting occured on October 14th, all of our group members attended and we met Mrs. Kristina House. We discussed if we were on the right track and fully understood what her vision was. We made sure we were crystal clear of what she would like us to build, and scheduled the next meeting. We also discussed the goal of the partner, for example, why she would like create something like this. The duration of the firt meeting was about 20 minutes.
 
The second meeting occured on October 16th, with all group members atteneding, we showed Mrs. Kristina House our first two prototypes of the website and the mobile app. We created a pdf file and a mp4 video of the prototypes for our partner to see. We also asked for any improvements and recommendations of the current prototype designs and features. The duration of the second meeting was also about 20 minutes.

The schedule for our future meetings is that we will meet every week on Wednesday to discuss our progress on the project and ask for opinions and guidelines. 

> **Note:** Most of the meetings will occur online via zoom calls.

## Q8: What artifacts will you use to self-organize?

We will use WeChat Group Chat as our main communication channel/tool for most of the group conversations.

We will assign weekly goals and individual responsibilities with each Saturday meeting, and have a progress check with every Thursday meeting to make sure everyone is on the same page.

> **Note:** We will also have storyboards to invisionize what the apps would look like.

## Q9: What are the rules regarding how your team works?
### Communications:

Twice a week, through Wechat Group and Zoom meeting

We will make a plan first to let our partner check, and we will then modify the plan as needed. When we try to add or remove a certain functionality, we will make a phone call to our partner first to discuss the details. We can also have a Zoom meeting if we need to demonstrate the new features we are working on to them.

### Meetings:

We do not have a moderator currently. Every team member should attend meetings and join the group chat extensively. If anyone shows reluctance to work, we have one specific meeting regarding this issue, and any actions necessary will be taken to make it right.

# Highlights

 1. The first decision is that we made clear understandings of the functionalities of this project. Not only by looking at the requirements on the project posting by our partner, we discussed all kinds of functionalities details of this project, by considering angles of different potential users, we designed together how to use the app/ web application under different scenarios. Some team members come up with some novel ideas on the extra possible functions we could make as the bonus part for the development of our project. Besides, we get familiar with each others’ preferred programming areas like front-end/ back-end, iOS or Android platform and assigned the general roles of each member according to their preferred choices. This decision reduces the conflicts and redundant learning time of our team.

 2. The second key decision we made was that 4 of our group members will start building the website front end, while two are working on the database and server side of the website. The reason is that only two people have been contacted with database knowledge, and they recommended themselves on this quest. And the working load of the web area takes quite a lot to process. Therefore, assigning tasks like this is the most effective and accessible way. Besides, if we have any conflicts or doubts on the duties of our own, we will discuss them in meetings and resolve them before proceeding to code.

 3. The third key decision is that we regulated our team rules and built a rewards and punishment system. By considering the time zone of all 6 members, we made a schedule on the appropriate time period that every team member was able to join the meeting. And by considering the amount of work we need to handle, we decided to meet twice a week. The first meeting is to plan the to-do list of the week, make sure clearly what we need to do this week and assign each member appropriate amounts of work, the second meeting is to update the progresses we made and discuss the issues we encountered by then. Arranging schedules like this can make sure the project processes normally and effectively. For the rewards and punishment system, the key point is to make sure our sub goals are achieved on time so that the whole project wouldn’t miss any deadlines. So we are asking our team members to try to finish their assigned work functionally by the deadline we set.
