## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Nov 19th, 2020
 * Where: Online via Zoom

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 #### Q1 Answer:
 
 * We decided to use Ionic and React to translate our web app to both ios app and Android app.
 
 Ionic is great in a way that it reduces the amount of work we need to do to accomplish our goals.
 For one thing, Ionic combined with React provides a very responsive web/ios/Android application front-end.
 Additionally, we do not need to write the ios and Andorid apps using Swift and Java, which was amazing.
 
 * We distributed the work by assigning the front-end to 4 people and back-end to 2 people.
 
 When we first started off planning our work, we thought that the front-end would take longer to implement in comparison with
 the back-end. It turned out true. The back-end consists of less code whereas the front-end is more complicated thus requiring
 more people to work on.
 
 * We decided to use MongoDB as our backend server and flask as the RESTful API to store user information,
 images and videos. It turned out working as expected.
 
 * We used github actions, fork, and pull request.
 
 With github actions, fork, and pull request, our workflow is really smooth and everything is more organized.
 Everyone can work on their own features and push their commits if they pass the build test by github actions.
 That allows us to have continuous deployment, making sure the main branch is always working.
 

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 #### Q2 Answer:
 
 * We wanted to use material-ui, but we did not
 
 We did not really use material-ui since it did not work well work ionic react, since ionic-react has its
 own set of components, conflicting with the one in material-ui. Thus, we gave up on material ui for now,
 and using only css styles to make our apps look good.
 
 * We wanted to use Swift and Java to write the mobile apps for our website
 
 Those two seperate mobile apps would require too much work, and we would not be able to finish the project on time,
 since we just had enoough time to build the website app, and translate it to ios and Androids versions.
 

#### Q3. Planned changes
1. We need to improve the GUI of the project since the idea of this project is simple, better GUI can attract more users.
2. We will implement SHARE button to the project since it will let user to share their work to others.
3. We will implement access functionality so the user can choose to set their work to private/public.
4. We will improve the built-in view experience like built-in photo view, and video play experience.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
